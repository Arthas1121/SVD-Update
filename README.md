This project is currently aimed at creating a means to read and write files through Sage. Thus removing the need
to switch to a different language in order to read in data or write created data to files. This may include reading
and writing of text-like, csv, image and audio files. We have yet to narrow down the list to specific file types and what
type of variable types will be created through reading of files. The applications of this project will be explored
throughout the creation process.
